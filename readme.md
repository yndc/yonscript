# Yonscript

Yonscript is a simple strongly-typed markup and scripting language designed for defining game assets and logic.

Yonscript code is compiled to byte-code by the Yonscript compiler, which is executable by the Yonscript virtual machine written in *TODO: language*.

This is a mono-repository for all Yonscript projects, including the bytecode compiler, virtual machine, CLI tool, and documentation.
